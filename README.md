# Arturia MiniLab MKII for Bitwig

This project is abandoned! I will leave it as a warning to other developers. It is not possible to integrate the Arturia MiniLab (mkI or mkII) into Bitwig. Arturia is using undisclosed communication protocol which u will not be able to recreate!

Do not buy Arturia hardware if you intend to use it with Bitwig, even less so if you are on Linux!
